# LabEG.NeedleCrud.Sample

Interactive sample application demonstrating **NeedleCrud** library capabilities with a complete Library Management API.

## 🎮 Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to try NeedleCrud:

```bash
docker pull labeg/needlecrud-sample:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 labeg/needlecrud-sample:latest
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** for interactive Swagger UI.

## 🏃 Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or higher

### Steps

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/LabEG/needle-crud.git
cd needle-crud/LabEG.NeedleCrud.Sample

# Run application
dotnet run

# Or with hot reload
dotnet watch run
```

Navigate to **https://localhost:5001** or **http://localhost:5000**

## 📚 Sample Data

The application uses an **InMemory database** with pre-seeded library data:

- 📖 **100 Books** - Various genres, authors, page counts
- ✍️ **20 Authors** - From different countries
- 👤 **10 Users** - Library members
- 📋 **10 Categories** - Fiction, Science, History, etc.
- 📝 **50+ Reviews** - Book ratings and comments
- 🔖 **Active Loans** - Currently borrowed books

Data is **automatically regenerated** on each restart.

## 📖 Understanding the Response

### Paginated Response Structure

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "title": "Sample Book",
      "pageCount": 350,
      "isAvailable": true,
      "author": {
        "id": "...",
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalCount": 87,
    "hasPreviousPage": false,
    "hasNextPage": true
  }
}
```

## 🐳 Docker

### Build Image

```bash
docker build -t needlecrud-sample -f LabEG.NeedleCrud.Sample/Dockerfile .
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 needlecrud-sample
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  needlecrud-sample:
    image: labeg/needlecrud-sample:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Database Context

Uses **InMemory database** for easy testing without external dependencies:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContextPool<LibraryDbContext>(options =>
{
    options.UseInMemoryDatabase("NeedleCrudSample");
});
```

### Service Registration

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(typeof(ICrudDbRepository<,,>), typeof(CrudDbRepository<,,>));
builder.Services.AddScoped(typeof(ICrudDbService<,,>), typeof(CrudDbService<,,>));
```

### Controller Example

```csharp
[Route("api/books")]
public class BooksController(ICrudDbService<LibraryDbContext, Book, Guid> service)
    : CrudController<Book, Guid>(service)
{
}
```

That's it! **3 lines of code** for a complete CRUD API.

### Data Seeding

Test data is automatically generated on startup using `TestDataGenerator`:
- Realistic book titles and author names
- Random ratings and reviews
- Proper entity relationships
- Consistent data across runs

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use Swagger UI** - Interactive API documentation with live testing
2. **Try different filters** - Experiment with operators and combinations
3. **Test pagination** - See how metadata changes with different page sizes
4. **Explore graphs** - Load related entities with nested includes
5. **Check performance** - InMemory is fast; try with real database for production
